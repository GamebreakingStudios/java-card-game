# java-card-game

A designer gave the following design for a card game to a developer:

> Implement the first phase of a card game in which a dealer shuffles a deck of cards and then deals a hand of 5 cards to each player.
> 
> The running program should produce the below output:
> 
> ```
> Nick has the below cards in their hand:
>   Ten of Diamonds
>   Four of Clubs
>   Queen of Hearts
>   Three of Diamonds
>   Nine of Diamonds
> Tommy has the below cards in their hand:
>   King of Hearts
>   Six of Diamonds
>   Ace of Clubs
>   Queen of Spades
>   Two of Hearts
> ```
> 
> Additionally, all tests should pass.

The developer has opened a pull request with their implementation of the card game. Your task is to review their pull request.
